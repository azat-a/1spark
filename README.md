# Frontend
This landing page based on layout designed by [Relkama](https://relkama.ru/) studio. In this project, I used adaptive layout, flex-boxes, grids, learned how to send forms and track which button the form was opened before sending.

# Backend
For the project, I wrote a primitive backend on PHP (using PHP Mailer library) that receives the form data and forwards it to the sales manager's email.

# Template
I write XSL template for UMI.CMS, learned XPath.
